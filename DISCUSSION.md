### Questions
- what is the point of S3 when images can be stored as binary/base64 on remote/client side
    - I guess they could be embedded easier in websites or something from the s3 public url
- is the logout "useless" since you're not really logged out in the sense that the app is still useable, only sync/image upload needs auth

### Discussion/mention
- about file storage stuff, since while uploading does upload to s3, it's also stored locally

### MVP local storage
- [ ] search not functional
- [ ] delete prompt not integrated to delete proces
    - the storage/grouping has to get reorganized I misunderstood that the pictures were separate regarding the tag info/owner info
- [ ] sync button disable toggle not tied to online/offline events
- [ ] prevent window from collapsing when keyboard comes up
- [ ] when you hit edit(while data saved) on owner info, content is emptied
- [ ] increase font size on bottom buttons tag upload page
- [ ] finish figuring out what's up with image meta for preview sizing
- [ ] [extra] add some kind of saving spinner maybe
- [ ] big photos take a while to load, interesting even locally stored
    - [ ] thumbanil generator is needed
- [ ] delete turned off until flow set(prompt) and also restructure data

- General note, can't add to home screen from incognito mode

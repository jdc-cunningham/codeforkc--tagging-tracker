### UI


### Sync
- [ ] add user_id field to tables in remote side so client side data is separate
    this allows the user to not login initially and be able to use the app, client side does not require user id
- [ ] make a full demo account where it has the spreadsheet data synced so anyone signing into app as that user will pull down that new data
